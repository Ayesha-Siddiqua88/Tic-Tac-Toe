###  How the game works

It is a game of 2 players in which both players make their entries or marks (X and O) alternatively.By default the first player is to take the mark X
while the other eventually takes O. The entry is to be made in a 3x3 grid or matrix until it reaches a goal. The goal of the player in Tic-Tac-Toe game 
is to get the same three marks in a row - horizontally, vertically or diagonally in a 3x3 grid. The first player to successfully acheive this goal will 
win the game.The game can be reset again after a round with the reset button provided.


The game also uses media queries to make it responsive to the device screen. To make it more appealing I added sound effects to it. Whenever the player 
clicks on any of the squares or when a player wins a game the sounds are played.
